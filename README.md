## 🚀 What Does This Do?

This Python program checks whether the **user’s input contains an EVEN or ODD number of letters**.

That’s it.  
No fluff.  
No guessing.  
Just straight-up letter math.

---

## 🧠 How It Works

1. Prompts the user for input
2. Counts the number of characters
3. Uses **modulo magic (`% 2`)** to decide:
   - ✅ EVEN
   - ❌ ODD
4. Prints the verdict

## 🧪 Example Output

```text
Enter text: Cat
The input has an ODD number of letters.
